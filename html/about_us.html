          ECO was founded in 1971 as CoEnCo to meet the needs of the conservation community. We became ECO in 1976. We
          are
          a non-profit network of 50+ organisations with a concern for conservation and the environment.

          <br><br>Our membership includes large international groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth,
          national
          groups including National Council of Women, as well as small local groups such as Kapiti Environmental Action
          and Save the Otago Peninsula, and issue oriented groups like the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust.

          <br><br>ECO has been centrally involved in campaigns to protect native forests, lakes and rivers, the reform
          of
          the Mining Act and defeat of the National Development Act, and in supporting the Resource Management Act and
          the
          establishment of the Department of Conservation and Ministry for the Environment. ECO continues to be at the
          forefront of environmental campaigns on fisheries, transport and environmental management.

          <br><br>ECO’s work is carried out largely by volunteers, supported by a small office and resource centre in
          Wellington. There are around 500 “Friends of ECO,” individual subscribers and others who support our work.

          <br><br>As well as working within New Zealand ECO maintains links with international networks, including the
          International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Environment Liaison Center International (ELCI),
          Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC), Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, and Climate Action Network
          (CAN).

              <p>Help Protect the Southern Ocean and the Ross Sea
                A special place requiring special protection

                The Ross Sea is a special place which is at risk from the impacts of fishing and the impacts of climate
                change and ocean acidification.

                ECO is supporting the protection of this special area. It is described as the last ocean as it is widely
                recognised as the only large ocean region on the earth which is the ecosystem is structured by natural
                rather than human forces. It has a rich biodiversity and it so far a relatively undisturbed place.

                The Ross Sea slope and shelf and associated waters comprise just 2 percent of the Southern Ocean, they
                are
                home to an estimated:
              <ul>
                <li>38 percent of the world Adelie penguin population</li>

                <li>26 percent of the world Emperor penguin population</li>

                <li>30 percent of the world Antarctic petrel population</li>

                <li>6 percent of the world Antarctic minke whale population</li>

                <li>45 percent of the world South Pacific Weddell seal population</li>

                <li>Over 40 species are found nowhere else</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              While New Zealand claims the Ross Sea as part of the Ross Dependency this claim is on hold due the
              agreements
              of the Antarctic Treaty. This means that the Ross Sea is high seas and subject to the rules under
              Antarctic
              Treaty system including the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

              The Ross Sea slope and shelf is deserving of full protection as a no-take marine reserve. This call has
              been
              endorsed by over 450 scientists from around the world.

                <li>Set a minimum resource consent term of 20 years for marine farms – ironically this may make it more
                  difficult for new species or unusual farming methods to get consents;</li>

                <li>Jointly notify the resource consent under the RMA and the undue adverse affects test under the

                  Act;</li>

              <p>Changes to aquaculture or marine farming legislation are like a repeat of a bad movie with Government
                Ministers failing to remember the mistakes of the past.

                <br><br>The current legislative framework was passed to control aquaculture after a gold rush of
                applications
                during the 1990s around the country. Local government couldn’t cope which was further exacerbated by the
                absence of resource rentals or rates which meant the aquaculture industry was getting marine space for
                free.

                <br><br>The Government rhetoric is that there has not been agreement to new space for 10 years but this
                ignores
                the huge increase in space that occurred between 1993 and 2003. Further much of the new areas consented,
                especially large new offshore areas (thousands of hectares), have only been partly used and it also
                unclear whether these new areas are economic.

                <br><br>The aquaculture industry has a goal of getting to $1 billion in exports by 2025, currently the
                exports
                are about $370 million. There has been no independent analysis to indicate whether this is possible or
                practical. There are only so much mussels that can be sold globally without depressing the price, there
                are competing salmon producers globally, and new fish species have yet to be shown to be economic and
                rely
                on fish feed coming from overseas wild fisheries, particularly Peru. The footprint of a finfish farm is
                much larger than a mussel or oyster farm and includes the fish and other feed used..

                <br><br>In a sneaky move the Government is to over-ride agreed coastal plans and allow marine farming
                consent
                holders in the Waikato and Marlborough to move from mussel farming to finfish farming without
                considering the additional environmental effects imposed. While fin fish farms involve the discharge of
                thousands of
                tonnes of fish food, no such impact occurs with mussel or oyster farming. This change in activity should
                be assessed like any other major change in activity through a resource consent process – it is like the
                Government removing discharge consent requirements from factory farms on land.
                The addition of the Minister of Aquaculture to the RMA is an ad hoc proposal which is not required for
                the sustainable management of the seas. This addition just panders to one industry without a solid
                justification and could lead to calls from other industries to have powers to over-ride conservation
                measures. The
                proposed Ministers powers are wide reaching and could result in the over-turning of publicly agreed
                measures and prohibitions on aquaculture. This addition means the Government does not trust the Minister
                of
                Conservation and regional councils to consider wider resource management issues. The Minister of
                Conservation currently has the role of approving regional coastal plans.

                <br><br>There currrently over 8,000 hectares of marine farming space which resource consent process is
                frozen
                and will be opened up under the Bill. ECO has requested further information on these areas.

                <br><br>Legislation to implement these changes was introduced by then Minister of Fisheries, Phil
                Heatley, at
                the end of 2010 and were passed in 2011.

                <br><br>As part of these changes the Government has appointed a Minister of Aquaculture. The Ministry of
                Fisheries (now Ministry of Primary Industry) has established a new aquaculture unit to promote
                aquaculture which
                will be separate from the functions to process new aquaculture applications to determine whether there
                is an
                “undue adverse effects” on fishing.

              <p>Changes to aquaculture or marine farming legislation are like a repeat of a bad movie with Government
                Ministers failing to remember the mistakes of the past.

                <br><br>The current legislative framework was passed to control aquaculture after a gold rush of
                applications
                during the 1990s around the country. Local government couldn’t cope which was further exacerbated by the
                absence of resource rentals or rates which meant the aquaculture industry was getting marine space for
                free.

                <br><br>The Government rhetoric is that there has not been agreement to new space for 10 years but this
                ignores
                the huge increase in space that occurred between 1993 and 2003. Further much of the new areas consented,
                especially large new offshore areas (thousands of hectares), have only been partly used and it also
                unclear whether these new areas are economic.

                <br><br>The aquaculture industry has a goal of getting to $1 billion in exports by 2025, currently the
                exports
                are about $370 million. There has been no independent analysis to indicate whether this is possible or
                practical. There are only so much mussels that can be sold globally without depressing the price, there
                are competing salmon producers globally, and new fish species have yet to be shown to be economic and
                rely
                on fish feed coming from overseas wild fisheries, particularly Peru. The footprint of a finfish farm is
                much larger than a mussel or oyster farm and includes the fish and other feed used..

                <br><br>In a sneaky move the Government is to over-ride agreed coastal plans and allow marine farming
                consent
                holders in the Waikato and Marlborough to move from mussel farming to finfish farming without
                considering the additional environmental effects imposed. While fin fish farms involve the discharge of
                thousands of
                tonnes of fish food, no such impact occurs with mussel or oyster farming. This change in activity should
                be assessed like any other major change in activity through a resource consent process – it is like the
                Government removing discharge consent requirements from factory farms on land.
                The addition of the Minister of Aquaculture to the RMA is an ad hoc proposal which is not required for

                MOKIHINUI - A WILD RIVER SAVED, Meridian withdraws its application
                <br><br>
                ECO welcomed the decision of Meridian Energy to withdraw its application for a dam on the Mohikinui
                River.
                <br><br>
                Meridian Energy initially received resource consent for the Mokihinui dam in April 2010 when the
                hearings
                committee found the issues difficult and the commissioners were split 2:1.
                <br><br>
                The Department of Conservation, Forest & Bird and others appealed the decision. The Appeal was expected
                to
                be heard in 2012.

          <div class="key-issue__hidden js-issue-hidden">
            <div class="text">
              <p>Meridian had planned to build an 85 metre high dam on the West Coast’s largest river. More than 330
                hectares of river gorge and forest will disappear under a 14 kilometre long artificial lake.

                <br><br>Forest and Bird’s Top of the South Field Officer, Debs Martin, described the proposal as”the
                greatest
                inundation of conservation land for a hydro scheme that New Zealand has ever seen. It is a tragedy for
                the
                native blue ducks, giant land snails, long fin eels and other creatures that live in or beside the
                Mokihinui. They will be wiped out by Meridian Energy’s massive hydro dam flooding their homes.”

                <br><br>Meridian also needed the approval of the Minister of Conservation, Hon. Kate Wilkinson to build
                the dam
                because the river is on public conservation land. Meridian has offered to swap other land for that
                needed
                for the Mokihinui project. This land would need to be of equivalent (or greater) ecological value and
                the
                <br><br>Department of Conservation has indicated that it would decline such an offer due to the
                irreplaceable
                value
                of the river.

                <br><br>Documents obtained under the Official Information Act have revealed that DOC was intending to
                turn down
                Meridian and believed “the public conservation land within the Mokihinui River has such high value that
                it
                is most unlikely to be suitable for exchange at all.”

                <br><br>Forest & Bird ran a successful campaign to give New Zealanders the chance to urge Meridian
                Energy to
                withdraw its proposal.

                <br><br>One irony was that Meridian was a recent sponsor of Project Crimson but the Mokihinui project
                would have
                drowned the very rata forests it pledged to protect.

                <br><br>Although water may be renewable a wild river is definitely not.

                <br><br>The argument of proponents for the project is that the Mokihinui project is required to provide
                a
                growing
                demand for power on the West Coast. Such a demand, perceived or real, could be satisfied by newly
                approved
                and more environmentally-friendly hydro projects. Solid Energy withdrew its appeal in October 2010 to
                Hydro
                Developments Limited’s Stockton scheme. This project aims to generate power using polluted water from
                the
                acid drainage of the Stockton coal mining area and will actually enhance the water quality of the
                Ngakawau
                River.

                <br><br>Together with Westpower’s Amethyst scheme (south of Hokitika) and Trust Power’s Arnold scheme
                (near
                Greymouth) this would provide three consented and largely unopposed energy projects located in
                already-modified landscapes, unlike Meridian’s competing proposal in a pristine wilderness.

                <br><br>The current West Coast peak demand is about 90MW at present, and is projected to grow to 111MW
                by 2020.
                The
                West Coast annual consumption is 317GWh (year of March 2009).

                <br><br>Current proposal of consented new supply of 46MW (190-220GWh) from the Arnold Scheme, 8MW
                (35GWh) from
                The
                Amethyst Scheme and 25MW (240GWh) from the Stockton, the West Coast would all but meet peak demand and
                exceed annual consumption to 2020. This meant that the West Coast did not need the Mohikinui dam.

                <br><br>Together with efficiency, conservation and co-generation initiatives to reduce demand we could
                look to a
                21st century solution: localized, small-scale and genuinely renewable.

                <br><br>The decision by Meridian to withdraw this project could signal the end of large new hydro
                developments
                in
                New Zealand. Earlier Contact Energy announced it was not proceeding with investigations for new power
                schemes on the Clutha River.

                <br><br>A combination of new geothermal projects in the North Island and wind power developments
                together with a
                decline in energy demand per capita means new renewables and energy efficiency should meet demand in the
                future.

                New National Environmental Standard for Plantation Forestry
                <br><br>
                The Ministry for the Environment (MfE) is currently developing new national level policy for plantation
                forestry to assist regional and district planning under the RMA. The work to date has focused on a
                proposed
                National Environmental Standard (NES) for Plantation Forestry as the tool of choice. A NES could be used
                to
                provide a consistent set of rules that apply across the country. Initially, MfE produced a discussion
                document which outlined a number of problems for improvement, and a possible remedy in the form of a new
                NES
                was proposed.

              <p>This document has since gone out for public consultation and all of the submissions received are now
                available to the public on the MfE website at:

                <br>http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/standards/forestry/submissions/index.html

                <br><br>ECO and many other submitters found that the discussion document dwelt on the desirability of
                efficiency
                and
                consistency in the treatment of plantation forestry, but tended to neglect environmental considerations
                which ought to be central to any improvements in the status quo under the RMA. The discussion document
                is
                aimed at a range of forestry activities including mechanical land preparation, afforestation,
                earthworks,
                the operation of quarries for the sake of forestry operations, and harvesting. The proposed NES in the
                discussion document suggested that many of the controls on these actvities could be done as nationally
                “Permitted Activities” with prescribed conditions and standards. This is in contrast to, rather than
                being
                subject to, differing rules and processes that currently occur under various regional and district plans
                and
                resource consents as is the status quo. On the positive side, regional and local councils could increase
                the
                standard’s stringency if they want to, but only in relation to a defined list of activities.

                <br><br>ECO made a substantive submission on this Proposed NES, and Co-chair Cath Wallace has met with
                and
                discussed
                issues of concern with the Ministry for the Environment and with the Forest Owners Association and the
                Institute of Forestry. Of major concern are the lack of alignment of the purpose of the NES with the
                Purpose
                and Principles of the Resource Management Act, and the lack of attention to biodiversity, pest control,
                and
                downstream effects especially on aquatic ecosystems and social effects. These are difficult to address
                using
                a NES tool due to its reliance on a prescriptive approach, which is in turn reliant on a high level of
                existing information, and on very tight definitions of rules in order to be effective. Many of the
                proposed
                definitions are considered problematic and would lead to substantial opportunity for ‘gaming’ the
                system,
                with a high likelihood of counter-productive environmental results.

                <br><br>ECO, like many other submitters, has raised questions as to how an activity-based NES would fit
                within
                an
                effects -based Act, and how the degree of specification could be achieved that would work for the
                variation
                of local conditions – even with an ability to increase the stringency of conditions for specified
                activities. ECO is particularly concerned that permissive conditions around “permitted activities” could
                result in creep of “permitted baselines” for other industries and their activities as well – though we
                recognise that these rules could also raise expectations on other industries in some aspects of their
                operation. Any ambiguity in the definition of activities covered by a new NES would produce a major risk
                factor in this regard, and there are many loose definitions in the discussion document. An example is
                that
                of “cultivation” which “includes drainage, felling bush, clearing land for cropping, and clearing land
                for
                planting” (p128).

                <br><br>On a positive note, Exec member Shane Orchard was amongst the participants attending a series of
                workshops
                convened by the Ministry for the Environment to address feedback from submitters and consider the range
                of
                approaches available to best address the issues. The workshops were held in November/early December 2010
                and
                covered topics such as erosion and plant invasion (wilding trees) More information and updates can be

                <br><br>There has been no further progress on the national standards as at mid-2012.

                But was more cautious on endorsing the collaborative approach used, because the current NZ model had
                been
                very much a pilot project and ECO believes it was not completely successful; for example it was not
                capable
                of delivering many of the stated objectives of the process. ECO regards that further work is required to
                develop the full potential of collaborative processes to address issues such as those considered by
                LAWF.

              <p>Land and Water Forum Report a brave start, which is yet to be proved
                ECO welcomed elements of the Land and Water Forum report when it was release in September 2010.

                <br><br>The unequivocal call for a National Policy Statement for Freshwater and National Environmental
                Standards
                is
                supported, but these standards and policies must be strict. ECO is cautious as to how other
                recommendations
                will be realised.

                <br><br>ECO was involved in the Land and Water Forum (LAWF - previously the Sustainable Land Use Forum)
                since it
                was
                established in June 2009. This Forum was run in parallel with the Government’s new strategy New Start
                for
                Fresh Water. ECO was a member of the LAWF Plenary meetings that received reports of process from an
                inner
                group which discussed the issues and negotiated principles but was mostly excluded from drafting and
                viewing
                documents.

                <br><br>The forum to explore a new process of collaboration within water management planning was an
                admirable
                concept but was inadequately implemented and so is still to be proved, with many interested parties not
                properly involved. The collaborative approach has been inspired by Scandinavian models and this was very
                much a pilot approach. To have integrity, a collaborative system has to work within a framework that
                guarantees genuine across-the-board consultation and a genuine shared vision of protecting our
                biodiversity,
                restoring our rivers and preventing on-going pollution.

                <br><br>The Government charged LAWF to:

                <br>conduct a stakeholder-led collaborative governance process to recommend reform of New Zealand’s
                fresh
                water
                management;

                <br>through a consensus process, identify shared outcomes and goals for fresh water and related land
                management;

                <br>identify options to achieve these outcomes and goals;

                <br>produce a written report which recommends shared outcomes, goals and long-term strategies for fresh
                water
                in
                New Zealand.

                <br><br>Overall there were 58 participating members included a range of industry (eg Fonterra and
                Federated
                Farmers), recreational and environmental, and local government, with observers from key government
                departments. The operating process focused mainly on water issues and ran a two tier process with an
                internal group (Small Group) comprising 21 stakeholders which were to report regularly to the external
                plenary group ( which included ECO).

                <br><br>ECO supported the Forum intentions to find ways for the community to avoid some aggressive and
                costly
                RMA
                court processes. Too often the community defending the environment for future generations is up against
                those with long pockets and profit to be made by over-extracting from our rivers and wetlands. ECO
                supported
                looking for less confrontational ways to discuss these serious issues and develop sound water
                strategies.

                <br><br>Environmental management requires a very strong legislative base like the RMA, because such
                significant
                profits can be made at the expense of the environment. Exploitation of the environment is why our
                lowland
                rivers and systems are being depleted and polluted by current practices.

                <br><br>The report has been mainly the production of the inner group with limited input from the plenary
                group.
                There was limited time or collaboration with plenary groups and little robust discussion in the plenary
                which was more a question and answer session than a process of engagement. This created significant
                problem
                for ECO Executive given some of the recommendations in the report. The ECO Executive considers that the
                problems with the process could have been resolved if there was sufficient time, modern electronic
                processes
                in consultation were used, and there was robust engagement with plenary members.

                <br><br>ECO said the report falls short of finding the formula to spell out to government. It remains to
                be seen
                whether the Government is committed to that vision and integrity. ECO supports attempts, but not the
                exact
                process used this time.


                <br><br>ECO believes that a range of issues remain and have not been resolved. These include:

                <br><br>Reaffirmation of Water Conservation Orders “for the purpose of recognising and sustaining
                outstanding
                amenity or intrinsic values of waters – including quality– in either a natural or modified state…”.

                <br><br>Avoiding extra-ordinary long-term consenting of major infrastructure, which will bind the hands
                of
                future
                generations and avoid periodic checks. The RMA allows consents up to 35 years and there is no reason why
                shorter consents and stronger review periods could not be used to provide greater environmental
                certainty.

                <br><br>Acknowledging hydro generation and dams on rivers as being a consumptive use of water.

                <br><br>Ensuring a more environmentally precautionary approach which acknowledges that current polluting
                practices
                can take decades to surface and will cost future generations dearly.

                <br><br>That future collaborative processes must be truly inclusive and collaborative of interested
                parties,
                with
                circulation of papers in development to interested parties, with much less secrecy in their development.
                Many organizations with an interest in these matters have been excluded from even seeing the papers – so
                the
                process used for this Land and Water Forum will need a major overhaul if it is to be adapted to other
                areas.
                This includes giving sufficient time and using modern electronic processes in consultation.

                <br><br>ther important issues include:

                <br>The focus of the report is on water and real consideration of sustainable land use is missing. This
                includes
                discussion on water requirement ratios of various forms/uses of food production or industry
                (agricultural
                or
                economic water use intensity).

                <br><br>The need for focus on reducing water demand as well as improving the efficiency of water use.
                For
                example
                recognising the extensive costs of intensive agriculture in terms of water quality and quantity and
                energy
                use, much greater research is needed into least-water-intensive and least-energy intensive food
                production.

                <br><br>Research should also be recommended for strategies to incentivise and support these future
                low-water-intensity food production industries.

              <p>Crown Minerals Bill Critically Compromises Conservation

                <br><br>The Cabinet not the Minister of Conservation will decide on the classification of conservation
                land and
                waters if a little-noticed amendment to the Crown Minerals Bill is passed. The Cabinet, via an Order in
                Council, will thus be able to remove land from National Parks, reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and
                virtually
                every other area with protected area. It gives an unprecedented degree of control over conservation to
                economic ministers who almost always out-rank the Minister of Conservation.

                <br><br>The Crown Minerals (Permitting and Crown Land) Bill is before the Commerce Select Committee
                which is
                hearing
                submissions. ECO presented its submission on the Bill in November.

                <br><br>The provisions to allow non-conservation ministers to determine and remove conservation
                designations is
                extra ordinarily damaging to conservation. Clearly designed to allow designation changes to permit
                minerals
                exploration and mining, it could and almost certainly will be used for many purposes by the economic
                ministers.

                <br><br>The Bill compromises conservation fundamentally and in many ways. The Minister of Conservation’s
                powers
                to
                decide on whether to allow specific minerals consents on Conservation land, are also eroded by an
                amendment
                to make the Minister in charge of Crown Minerals a joint decision maker. Conservation values are sure to
                be
                damaged by this provision.

                <br><br>Schedule 4 which puts some protected areas and classifications off limits to minerals activity,
                is
                preserved
                intact as promised by the government after the public rebelled against the government’s earlier plans to
                allow exploration and mining in these areas. Readers may recall that John Key promised not to allow
                mining
                on World Heritage areas and National Parks. This Bill will allow the Cabinet to reclassify minerals
                prospective areas so that they no longer have such conservation designations. That was the device that
                the
                Australian government used to allow a uranium mine in the middle of the Kakadu World Heritage Area: they
                simply defined it out of the Area.

                <br><br>“The Bill is a slap in the face for all the people who care about conservation, and it is sneaky
                in also
                changing the Conservation Act, the Reserves Act, the Wildlife Act, the Continental Shelf Act, the
                Forests
                Act and others,” ECO Co-Chairperson, Cath Wallace said.

                <br><br>The Bill also removes the power to create a whole range of reserves from Forests Act lands. The
                provision
                in
                the Forests Act that recreation reserves, historic reserves, scenic, scientific or nature reserves can
                be
                created from Forest land is being removed (Cl 64)

                <br><br>The Bill adds a purpose to “promote” minerals activity, rather than to “regulate” or “manage”
                minerals
                activity. This change sets the scene for numerous provisions that disadvantage all other interests than
                those of the exploration and mining industry. It gives MoBIE a massive conflict of interest between its
                promotion and regulatory functions.

                <br><br>Instead of using the same grounds applied to consenting for tourism, recreation and filmmaking
                activities
                in
                protected areas, mining is given a super soft deal in the conservation estate. Yet exploration and
                mining
                are inconsistent with conservation purposes.

                <br><br>For all the other activities, the Conservation Act applies and the Minister of Conservation may
                not
                allow
                them if they are incompatible with the conservation or reserve purpose of the land, yet for exploration
                and
                mining this test is to be waived.

                <br><br>A matter of particular concern is that applications for minerals permits do not have to be kept
                in a
                public
                register. This requirement was introduced as long ago as 1983 but has been since quietly dropped.

                <br><br>The length of the term of minerals permits is being extended. Holders of prospecting and
                exploration
                permits
                already have an automatic right to renew their permits or to exchange them for exploration or mining
                permits
                (s32 of the CMA) with no change to the conditions. Mining permits may have a 40 year term (s35) with a
                further right to renew for another 40 years.

                <br><br>The Bill proposes that a holder of a prospecting permit may have successive rights to permits
                which in
                total
                may last for 118 years with no ability to change the conditions! Existing permits from almost 80 years
                ago
                can continue under the old rules.

                <br><br>Overall, ECO strongly objects to the undermining of conservation principles and the subjugation
                of
                intrinsic
                and non-extractive values and functions of the environment by this Bill as it allows economic ministers
                to
                decide conservation classifications and make other conservation-critical decisions.

                <br><br>Mining Conservation Land and World Heritage

                <br><br>International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has called on all Governments to stop
                mining in
                World
                Heritage Areas. IUCN is an organisation of 200 government and 800 non-governmental organisations.

                <br><br>Under the 4th Schedule of the Crown Minerals Act 1991 not all high conservation value land is
                protected
                from
                minerals activity. Schedule 4 protected land does not prevent mining in some World Heritage Areas and
                other
                specially protected areas like ecological areas,marine mammal sanctuaries, conservation parks. This
                Schedule
                does not prevent miners operating mines under, for example national parks, or clearing native vegetation
                for
                service or emergency adits.

                <br><br>World Heritage areas not specifically covered by the 4th Schedule. The areas not protected
                include over
                320,000 hectares on land in the West Coast and Southland in Te Wāhiponamu World Heritage Area and most
                of
                the marine areas in the Sub-Antarctic World Heritage Area apart from the area covered by the Auckland
                Islands marine reserve.

                <br><br>The Fourth Schedule of the Crown Minerals Act was passed by a National Party Government in 1997
                under
                section 3 of the Crown Minerals Amendment Act (No 2) 1997. This prohibits mineral activity on
                conservation
                land gazetted as national parks, nature reserves, scientific reserves, wilderness areas, marine
                reserves,
                forest sanctuaries, wildlife sanctuaries, wetlands of international importance, and the Coromandel
                Peninsula, Hauraki Gulf, and associated offshore islands.

                <br><br>IUCN has called on the mining, oil and gas industries, as well as governments who licence
                mineral
                extraction, to follow the example of business leaders who have already committed not to undertake mining
                and
                oil/gas projects within World Heritage sites.

                <br><br>The IUCN statement was made at the latest World Heritage Meeting in Paris. New Zealand has
                international
                obligations as a member of the World Heritage Convention.

                <br><br>IUCN’s position was that ‘mineral and oil/gas exploration and exploitation should not be
                permitted
                within
                natural World Heritage Sites. Further, Mining and oil/gas projects that are located outside World
                Heritage
                Sites should not, under any circumstances, have negative impacts on these exceptional places. Moreover,
                boundary changes to these sites should not be used as an easy way to facilitate mining activities.’

                <br><br>Proposals to include some World Heritage areas in exploration, prospecting or mining will
                further alarm
                the
                international conservation community. Crown Minerals has already granted or has applications for
                prospecting
                and exploration licences for coal and gold which cover Te Wāhiponamu World Heritage Area. Licences
                granted
                include the state owned miner Solid Energy.” Examples of minerals permits which include World Heritage
                <br><br>Areas
                include:

                Currently in New Zealand mineral activity has a privileged status and is not subject to the usual
                provisions
                that apply to other activity in Conservation areas. That must be changed so all activities are judged by
                the
                same standards and to allow public input.

                <br><br>Tourism activity, hut building, and roading is subject to the concessions provisions of the
                Conservation
                Act, which includes environmental impact assessment and public processes, but miners currently gain
                access
                under the weaker and secretive provisions of the Crown Minerals Act.

                <br><br>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, a body of 200
                governmental
                agencies and 800 non-governmental organisations, has passed resolutions calling on all countries to stop
                mining on category I to IV protected areas, which applies to nearly all categories conservation land.

                <br><br>According to IUCN companies such as Shell and the financial services firm JP Morgan, as well as
                the
                International Council on Mining and Metals, which brings together many of the world’s major mining
                companies, have recognized the importance of conserving World Heritage Sites and have committed not to
                undertake activities that would damage them.

                <br><br>Around 8% of the world’s protected areas are World Heritage Sites—places recognized as having
                ‘outstanding
                universal value’ because of their natural or cultural significance. <br><br>There are:
                <br><br>• 911 places are listed as World Heritage sites
                <br>• 34 sites are included on the ‘World Heritage in Danger’ list
                <br>• The Great Barrier Reef is the largest natural World Heritage site

              <p>New Zealand must fill ocean law gaps
                The Government needs to urgently fill gaps in maritime law so it has measures in place to control oil
                exploration and mining on the continental shelf.

                <br><br>Frankly it’s wrong to claim New Zealand has the environmental laws and regulations to control
                oil and
                gas
                development on the continental shelf. There is no equivalent of the Resource Management Act to control
                oil
                and gas activity outside of the territorial sea (12 nautical miles offshore).

                <br><br>The Maritime Transport Act covers some aspects of safety and environmental provisions for oil
                and gas
                activity on the Exclusive Economic Zone (from 12 to 200 nautical miles offshore) and the continental
                shelf
                but this did not include key environmental controls which led to the adoption of some unenforceable
                voluntary codes.

                <br><br>The Government had long recognised gaps in environmental law and as part of the Ocean’s policy
                process
                had
                proposed in 2007 to fill “key gaps in EEZ environmental regulation and promote a consistent approach to
                environmental management across different statutes.” The gaps in oceans management and the need for
                oceans
                policy was first recognised by the National Government in 1999 by the Minister for the Environment,
                Simon
                Upton and then Minister of Conservation Nick Smith.

                <br><br>The gaps includes environmental assessment procedures and public participation and the impacts
                of
                climate
                change.

                <br><br>The Maui gasfield, the Tui oil field, and the Kupe gas field are found offshore Taranaki outside
                the
                area
                managed by the Resource Management Act in relatively shallow water. The Tui field is located about 50km
                offshore at a water depth of about 120m. Kupe is a gas and light oil field about 30km offshore at water
                depth of about 35m.

                <br><br>The new areas being promoted by the Government are in much deeper water. The Petrobras permit is
                in
                water
                up
                to 3000m deep which is much deeper than current operating fields and, as shown by the Deepwater Horizon
                spill in the Gulf of Mexico, would be very challenging if not impossible to deal with any spill. The
                Canterbury Basin exploration area offshore from Dunedin and the Great South Basin, south of
                Invercargill,
                are in deep water of more than 1000 metres. Any response to a spill would take many months.

                <br><br>Putting aside the climate change arguments that New Zealand should be calling a halt to new oil
                and gas
                exploration the current rules are inadequate. Relying on the Maritime Transport Act and voluntary codes
                or
                practice is not sufficient and the oil industry itself has recognised the need for change.

                <br><br>The current voluntary guidelines for environmental assessment and impacts on marine mammals are
                not
                sufficient for the management of the environmental aspects of oil and gas exploration and development.
                The
                voluntary guidelines which have no legislative force include:

                <br><br>Environmental Best Practice Guidelines for the Offshore Petroleum Industry;

                <br><br>Department of Conservation guidelines to minimise disturbance on marine mammals of mineral
                seismic
                surveys.
                These guidelines are being reviewed. The review has shown that other countries considered –(Australia,
                Brazil, Canada, US, and the UK) have legal requirements to avoid impacts on marine mammals which are
                known
                to be sensitive to seismic activity.

                <br><br>Other species affected by seismic surveys include squid, octopus and cuttlefish. Research by
                Michel
                Andre
                of
                the Technical University of Catalonia in Barcelona, and colleagues in Spain and Franceshowed damage in
                these
                creatures after just two hours exposure to low frequency noise from 50-400 hertz, noise described as an
                “acoustic smog” typical of oil and gas exploration and shipping. The research followed death events of
                giant
                squid washed up on Spanish beaches in 2001 and 2003 caused by nearby oil and gas seismic surveys.

                <br><br>The scientists found that the organ that allows squid, octopus and cuttlefish to regulate their
                positions,
                to balance and direct how and where they swim, was damaged leaving the animals unable to move or to
                feed,
                and vulnerable to predators.

                <br><br>The previous government was drafting oceans law prior to the 2009 election to fill the current
                gaps and
                ratify international agreements but this had not been taken up by the current government.

                <br><br>The proposals to develop gap filling legislation were consulted on in 2007 and 2008. Information
                can be
                found on the Ministry for the Environment website.

                <br><br>While the Minister for the Environment, Nick Smith, has recognised the need for change, the
                Government
                has
                yet to introduce new oceans law or ratify important international maritime law. The Ministry for the
                Environment in its latest Statement of Intent (May 2010) acknowledges that the Government has yet to
                decide
                on oceans policy and gap filling legislation.

                <br><br>New Zealand has not ratified a number of international agreements on maritime law including the
                Protocol
                of
                2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for
                Oil
                Pollution Damage, 1992 (Fund Protocol) and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker
                Oil
                Pollution Damage, 2001 (Bunkers Convention). New Zealand has still to ratify Annex IV and VI of the
                Marine
                Pollution Convention which Australia has already ratified.

                <br><br>ECO urges the Government to give greater priority to sort out these legislative flaws before we
                have a
                disaster exacerbated by legislative failure.

                PLASTIC FREE JULY - The Challenge
                <br>
                <br>The challenge is quite simple. Attempt to consume no single-use plastic during July.
                <br>
                <br>“Single-use” includes plastic shopping bags, plastic cups, straws, plastic packaging…basically
                anything
                that’s intended only to be used once and then sent to landfill. If refusing ALL single-use plastic
                sounds
                too daunting this time, try the TOP 4 challenge (straws, plastic bags, plastic bottles & coffee cup
                lids).

                Why you should participate

                <br><br>Plastic, in many areas of the world, has become a significant and deadly part of the food chain.
                Humans
                have
                a heavy reliance on the plastics industry; it’s a cheap product that is incredibly versatile. Plastics
                manufacturing and use has grown exponentially over the last decade, as has our plastic waste. 225
                million
                tonnes of plastic is produced each year and unfortunately a significant amount of that ends up in our
                oceans. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch has a huge amount of plastic waste which has a detrimental
                effect
                on
                marine life.

                <br><br>Why use something for a few seconds that is going to spend the rest of your life trying to break
                down in
                landfill? We really need to change our habits.

                <br><br>SMOKING’S IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

                <br>According to the WHO there are currently over 1 billion smokers globally. 6 Million of those smokers
                will
                die each year from a smoking related illness.

                <br><br>The negative consequences of smoking range far from just the health effects on the individual.
                The
                environmental impact caused by improper disposal of cigarette butts is as large as it is concerning.

                <br><br>Each year 4.5 trillion cigarette butts are discarded improperly around the world. They are the
                single
                most
                littered item in existence, ever.

                <br><br>It is in our towns and cities that the vast majority of cigarette ends are discarded improperly.
                With
                the
                help of wind and rain they are often blown or washed into our waterways. They then either remain in our
                lakes and rivers, make their way to the ocean, or get washed up in our natural spaces.

                <br><br>While in our waterways cigarette butts can often be mistaken for food by aquatic life. If a
                human adult
                ingests a cigarette butt they are likely to have some mild health consequences such as vomiting and a
                upset
                stomach. Imagine the pain and suffering ingesting a cigarette butt would cause to an animal the size of
                a
                fish. (Symptoms include vomiting, respiratory failure, and often death.)

                <br><br>If the cigarette butt gets washed out of our waterways onto a riverbank or onto the beach, non
                marine
                life
                faces the same issue. Land animals will also mistake it for food, ingest it, and receive the same
                potentially lethal consequences as aquatic life.

                <br><br>To make matters worse, (contrary to popular belief) cigarette butts are not biodegradable. They
                can take
                up
                to 25 years to fully degrade. While they do so they are releasing over 4000 toxins into the soil or
                water
                that surrounds them

                <br><br>It would be tempting to discount this issue due to the small size of a cigarette butt. However a
                study
                conducted by SDSU found that a single cigarette butt placed in a 1 litre tank of water killed half the
                fish
                in the tank.

                <br><br>When we remember our initial statistic of 4.3 trillion improperly discarded cigarettes butts
                each year,
                the
                cause for concern arising from these toxic chemicals entering our ecosystem becomes apparent.

                <br><br>So what can we do to reduce the amount of harm caused to our environment by cigarette litter?

                <br><br>Various research organizations and public health bodies around the world have proposed a variety
                of
                solutions to this issue. However one main common solution to the issue is commonly agreed upon.

                <br><br>Many people are simply unaware of just how large the problem of improperly disposed cigarette
                litter is.
                They are unaware of how harmful it is to the environment.

                <br><br>Through education and awareness campaigns it is possible to reduce the amount of cigarette
                litter that
                is
                improperly disposed of, reducing the scale of the problem.

                <br><br>It’s time to start treating cigarette butts like the toxic waste they actually are.

                <br><br>The organisation Quitza is a non profit where users from all over the world support each other
                while
